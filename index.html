            <p>"Voldemort's back, Harry?  You're sure he's back?  How did he do it?" 
                "He took stuff from his father's grave, and from Wormtail, and me," said Harry.  His head felt clearer; his scar wasn't hurting so badly; he could now see Moodys face distinctly, even though the office was dark.  He could still hear screaming and shouting from the distant Quidditch field. 
                "What did the Dark Lord take from you?" said Moody. 
                "Blood," said Harry, raising his arm.  His sleeve was ripped where Wormtail's dagger had torn it. 
                Moody let out his breath in a long, low hiss. 
                "And the Death Eaters?  They returned?" 
                "Yes," said Harry.  "Loads of them . . ." 
                "How did he treat them?"  Moody asked quietly.  "Did he forgive them?" 
                But Harry had suddenly remembered.  He should have told Dumbledore, he should have said it straightaway - 
                "There's a Death Eater at Hogwarts!  There's a Death Eater here - they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end -" 
                Harry tried to get up, but Moody pushed him back down. 
                "I know who the Death Eater is," he said quietly. 
                </p>
            <p>"I had help on the egg in the first place," said Cedric. 
                "We're still square," said Harry, testing his leg gingerly; it shook violently as he put weight on it; he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him. 
                "You should've got more points on the second task," said Cedric mulishly.  "You stayed behind to get all the hostages.  I should've done that." 
                "I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!"  said Harry bitterly.  "Just take the cup!" 
                "No," said Cedric. 
                He stepped over the spider's tangled legs to join Harry, who stared at him.  Cedric was serious.  He was walking away from the sort of glory Hufflepuff House hadn't had in centuries. 
                "Go on," Cedric said.  He looked as though this was costing him every ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were folded, he seemed decided. 
                Harry looked from Cedric to the cup.  For one shining moment, he saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it.  He saw himself holding the Triwizard Cup aloft, heard the roar of the crowd, saw Cho's face shining with admiration, more clearly than he had ever seen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric's shadowy, stubborn face. 
                "Both of us," Harry said. 
                "What?" 
                "We'll take it at the same time.  It's still a Hogwarts victory.  We'll tie for it." 
                Cedric stared at Harry.  He unfolded his arms. 
                </p>
            <p>"Maybe Harry can hear us, Dad - maybe he'll be able to let us out-" 
                There was a loud hammering of fists on the boards behind the electric fire. 
                "Harry? Harry, can you hear us?" 
                The Dursleys rounded on Harry like a pair of angry wolverines. 
                "What is this?" growled Uncle Vernon. "What's going on?" 
                "They - they've tried to get here by Floo powder," said Harry, fighting a mad desire to laugh.  "They can travel by fire - only you've blocked the fireplace - hang on -" 
                He approached the fireplace and called through the boards. 
                "Mr. Weasley?  Can you hear me?" 
                The hammering stopped.  Somebody inside the chimney piece said, "Shh!" 
                "Mr. Weasley, it's Harry ... the fireplace has been blocked up.  You won't be able to get through there." 
                "Damn!" said Mr. Weasley's voice.  "What on earth did they want to block up the fireplace for?" 
                "They've got an electric fire," Harry explained. 
                </p>
            <p>"If Snape hadn't held me up," Harry said bitterly, "we might've got there in time.  'The headmaster is busy. Potter . . . what's this rubbish, Potter?'  Why couldn't he have just got out of the way?" 
                "Maybe he didn't want you to get there!" said Ron quickly.  "Maybe - hang on - how fast d'you reckon he could've gotten down to the forest?  D'you reckon he could've beaten you and Dumbledore there?" 
                "Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something," said Harry. 
                "Wouldn't put it past him," Ron muttered. 
                "We need to see Professor Moody," said Hermione.  "We need to find out whether he found Mr. Crouch," 
                "If he had the Marauder's Map on him, it would've been easy," said Harry. 
                "Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds," said Ron, "because it only shows up to the boundaries, doesn't -" 
                "Shh!" said Hermione suddenly. 
                Somebody was climbing the steps up to the Owlery.  Harry could hear two voices arguing, coming closer and closer. 
                "- that's blackmail, that is, we could get into a lot of trouble for that-" 
                "- we've tried being polite; it's time to play dirty, like him.  He wouldn't like the Ministry of Magic knowing what he did -" 
                "I'm telling you, if you put that in writing, it's blackmail!" 
                </p>
            <!-- <p>"Ow!"  said Hermione, tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin, but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick, knobbly gloves. 
                "You'd better get up to the hospital wing," said Harry as the owls around Hermione took flight.  "We'll tell Professor Sprout where you've gone. . . ." 
                "I warned her!"  said Ron as Hermione hurried out of the Great Hall, cradling her hands. "I warned her not to annoy Rita Skeeter!  Look at this one ..."  He read out one of the letters Hermione had left behind: "I read In Witch Weekly about how you are playing Harry Potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and I will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as I can find a big enough envelope.'  Blimey, she'd better watch out for herself." 
                Hermione didn't turn up for Herbology.  As Harry and Ron left the greenhouse for their Care of Magical Creatures class, they saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle descending the stone steps of the castle.  Pansy Parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of Slytherin girls.  Catching sight of Harry, Pansy called, "Potter, have you split up with your girlfriend?  Why was she so upset at breakfast?" 
                Harry ignored her; he didn't want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the Witch Weekly article had caused. 
                Hagrid, who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns, was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet.  Harrys heart sank at the sight of the crates - surely not another skrewt hatching? - but when he got near enough to see inside, he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts.  Their front paws were curiously flat, like spades, and they were blinking up at the class, looking politely puzzled at all the attention. 
                "These're nifflers," said Hagrid, when the class had gathered around.  "Yeh find 'em down mines mostly.  They like sparkly stuff. . . . There yeh go, look." 
                One of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite Pansy Parkinson's watch off her wrist. She shrieked and jumped backward. 
                "Useful little treasure detectors," said Hagrid happily.  "Thought we'd have some fun with 'em today.  See over there?"  He pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth Harry had watched him digging from the Owlery window.  "I've buried some gold coins.  I've got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most.  Jus' take off all yer valuables, an' choose a niffler, an get ready ter set 'em loose." 
                Harry took off his watch, which he was only wearing out of habit, as it didn't work anymore, and stuffed it into his pocket.  Then he picked up a niffler.  It put its long snout in Harry's ear and sniffed enthusiastically. It was really quite cuddly. 
                "Hang on," said Hagrid, looking down into the crate, "there's a spare niffler here . . . who's missin?  Where's Hermione?" 
                "She had to go to the hospital wing," said Ron.
